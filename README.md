# Xacōlang

Ok what it's "xacōlang"? 
It's my second constracted language, which 
I am creating. I've been inspired by aztec language called "nahuatl",
but...I've done some changes in grammar of nahuatl. I' ve done conjugation and I want to make less of tenses. I want to make completely different vocabulary and very easy language for everyone. 


# what it means "xacō"?

"Xacō" (/ʃako/) means "a book". It isn't any reference to any language, but...it sounds very well in my opinion, isn't it?

# what next?
I treat it as fun and I will have much fun of creating this language. I invite you to see my language and I hope you will enjoy it.
