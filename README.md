# Xacōlang

Ok what it's "xacōlang"? 
It's my second constracted language, which 
I am creating. I've been inspired by aztec language called "nahuatl",
but...I've done some changes in nahautl's grammar. I added conjugation and I want to smaller number of tenses. I want to make completely different vocabulary and very easy language for everyone. 


# what it means "xacō"?

"Xacō" (/ʃakoː/) means "a book". It isn't a reference to any language, but... it sounds very nice in my opinion, doesn't it?

# what next?
I treat it as fun excersise and I will have much fun creating this language. I invite you to see it and I hope you will enjoy it.
